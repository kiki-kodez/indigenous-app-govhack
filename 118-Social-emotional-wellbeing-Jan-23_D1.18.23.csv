"Table D1.18.23: Intentional self harm mortality rates by Indigenous status by age (to 75+) and sex, NSW, Qld, WA, SA and NT, 2011â€“15"
""
"This table is no longer provided as it is similar to table D1.18.22 but with more age groups. Due to small counts in age groups above 55 years in this table the rates are suppressed,  which makes it less informative as table 1.18.22. "
