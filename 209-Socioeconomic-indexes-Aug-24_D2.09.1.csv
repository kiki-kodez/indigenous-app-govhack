Notes,,,,,
1. Cells in this table have been randomly adjusted to avoid the release of confidential data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.,,,,,
2. Data excludes Overseas Visitors and persons who did not state their Indigenous status.,,,,,
3. SEIFA = Socio Economic Indexes for Areas.,,,,,
"4. SEIFA is a collection of four indexes, each summarising a different aspect of the socio-economic conditions in an area using different Census data: IRSAD focuses on both advantage and disadvantage; the IRSD focuses on relative socio-economic disadvantage; the IEO focuses on relative Education and Occupation advantage and disadvantage; the IER focuses on Economic advantage and disadvantage. The same area may score differently for each index. Deciles are based on a national area-based index ranking of Statistical Area 1 (SA1) of Usual Residence.",,,,,
