"* Represents statistically significant differences at the p < 0.05 level. Rate ratios tested. For Alcohol consumption, 'Abstained' was also tested against those who did not have 'Short term/single occasion risk'. For those with disability or a long-term health condition, level of disability/long-term health condition was also tested with 'Total with disability/long-term health condition' used as the reference category. Number of long term health conditions were also tested with 'Three or more' as the reference category.",,,,,
(a) Based on the Kessler-5 (K5) measure of psychological distress. Overall levels of distress are based on how often respondents reported experiencing each feeling. Low/moderate is a score of 5–11. High/very high is a score of 12–25.,,,,,
"(b) Totals for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people exclude a small number of people who were not present at interview and for whom responses were provided by a proxy, and persons for whom level of psychological distress was unable to be determined.",,,,,
(c) Excludes 'not known'.,,,,,
(d) Excludes 'not stated'.,,,,,
"(e) Total includes 'other', 'rent free' and 'life tenure scheme'.",,,,,
(f) Including participants of rent/buy (or shared equity) scheme.,,,,,
"(g) Households requiring at least 1 additional bedroom, based on the Canadian National Occupancy Standard for Housing Appropriateness.",,,,,
(h) Abstainer includes those who have never consumed alcohol.,,,,,
(i) Includes those who drank alcohol. Risk level calculated on exceeding the NHMRC Australian Alcohol Guidelines 2009. For short-term/single occasion risk this is 5 or more standard drinks on any day over last 12 months.,,,,,
(j) Physical activity data collected from persons 18 years and over; and Non-remote areas only. ,,,,,
(k) 150 minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity from 5 or more sessions over a week (based on previous guidelines).,,,,,
(l) Includes 'don't know'.,,,,,
"(m) Self-reported data consisting of persons who report having a disability or restrictive long-term health condition where a limitation, restriction, impairment, disease or disorder has lasted, or is expected to last for 6 months or more, and restricts everyday activities. This item is not time series comparable as the categories have been updated.",,,,,
"(n) Levels of activity limitation (profound, severe, moderate, mild and school/employment restriction only) are based on whether, and how often, a person needs help, has difficulty, or uses aids or equipment with any core activities (self-care, mobility or communication). A person's overall level of core activity limitation is determined by their highest level of limitation in any of these activities. ",,,,,
(o) Only current difficulties with education and/or employment were collected. Respondents aged 65 and over were not asked about employment restrictions and so some may be categorised as not having a specific limitation or restriction that would otherwise have been assigned 'schooling/employment restriction only' had they been asked the question.,,,,,
"(p) Has disability includes; persons with a core activity limitation (profound, severe, moderate and mild), persons with a schooling/employment restriction only, and persons living with an impairment but having no limitation or specific restriction with everyday activities of mobility, self-care and communication or schooling/employment.",,,,,
"(q) Self-reported data consisting of persons reporting a current medical condition which has lasted, or is expected to last, for 6 months or more.",,,,,
