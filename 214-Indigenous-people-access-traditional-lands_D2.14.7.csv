† Estimate has a relative standard error between 25% and 50% and should be used with caution.,,,,,,
‡ Estimate has a relative standard error greater than 50% and is considered unreliable for general use.,,,,,,
(a) 2018–19 is not comparable to previously provided National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey data due to different applicable age group.,,,,,,
(b) Includes 'don't know whether allowed to visit homelands/traditional country'.,,,,,,
(c) The 2018–19 survey includes refusal responses. The previous surveys exclude refusals and not asked.,,,,,,
(d) The 2018–19 survey used a different age group of 18 and over for asking  these and other questions on cultural identification. The previous surveys had consistently used the age group 15 and over. Hence the total percentage values and total numbers from 2018–19 are not comparable with equivalent totals from previous surveys.,,,,,,
(e) The 2018–19 survey includes only those present at the interview.,,,,,,
Note: Percentages add within rows. Estimates have been rounded and discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals. ,,,,,,
