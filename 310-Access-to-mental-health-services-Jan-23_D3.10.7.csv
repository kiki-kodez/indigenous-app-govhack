"(a) Age-standardised (age-std.) rates have been calculated using the direct method, with 2001 Australian population by 5-year age groups (up to 75+) as the standard population. ",,,,,,,,,
(b)  Rate ratio is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians divided by the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,
"(c) Due to small numbers, areas in Victoria classified as Remote under the ASGS 2016 Remoteness Structure are excluded from the ‘Remote’ category and are instead included in the 'Non-remote' category. There are no areas in Victoria classified as Very remote under the ASGS 2016 Remoteness Structure.",,,,,,,,,
(d) Persons data includes sex not stated and indeterminate.,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,
1. Data are from public and private hospitals in all jurisdictions.,,,,,,,,,
2. Population denominators used to calculate rates were modelled by the AIHW using available ABS population estimates and projections (series B). ,,,,,,,,,
3. Data are reported by jurisdiction and remoteness of usual residence of the patient hospitalised.,,,,,,,,,
"4. Remoteness is based on the Area Structure within the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, ‘Non-remote’ refers to Major cities, Inner regional and Outer regional areas combined, while ‘Remote’ refers to Remote and Very remote areas combined. ",,,,,,,,,
"5. Categories are based on the ICD-10-AM 10th edition (Australian Consortium for Classification Development 2017): ICD-10-AM codes F00–F99 (Mental and behavioural disorders) and other mental health-related conditions: G30, G47.0, G47.1, G47.2, G47.8, G47.9, O99.3, R44, R45.0, R45.1, R45.4, R48, Z00.4, Z03.2, Z04.6, Z09.3, Z13.3, Z50.2, Z50.3, Z54.3, Z61.9, Z63.1, Z63.8, Z63.9, Z65.8, Z65.9, Z71.4, Z71.5, Z76.0. Information about their definition can be found at https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/classifications-and-technical-notes.",,,,,,,,,
"6. Data exclude hospitalisations for Newborns without qualified days, Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement and ICD codes F52.5, F84.2, F98.5 and F98.6.",,,,,,,,,
"7. Data exclude hospitalisations in WA with a contracted patient status of 'Inter-hospital contracted patient to private sector hospital', to adjust for hospitalisations recorded on both sides of contractual care arrangements.",,,,,,,,,
