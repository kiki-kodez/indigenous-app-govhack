"(a) Data for 2010 have been adjusted for the additional deaths arising from outstanding registrations of deaths in Queensland in 2010. For further information see the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period (https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/causes-death-australia-methodology/2019).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b)  Since 2015, the Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages used both medical certificate information and death registration form information to derive Indigenous status. This approach has been used in South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory since 2007. If either source indicates that the deceased was an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person, they are recorded as such. In New South Wales and Victoria, only information from the death registration form is used (see  the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-release)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(c) Annual change is determined using linear regression analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(d) Per cent change is based on the annual change over the period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(e) Directly age-standardised using the 2001 Australian standard population, by 5-year age groups up to 75+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(f) Rate ratio is the age-standardised  rate for Indigenous Australians divided by the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(g) Rate difference is the age-standardised  rate for Indigenous Australians minus the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Categories are based on the ICD-10 10th Revision (World Health Organization): Intentional self harm ICD-10 codes X60–X84, Y87.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.  A number of deaths occur each year for which the Indigenous status is not stated on the death registration form—0.8% of all deaths registered in 2019. Thus, there is some degree of under-identification of Indigenous people in mortality data. For further information see the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 (https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/causes-death-australia-methodology/2019)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.  All causes of death data from 2006 onward are subject to a revisions process. Once data for a reference year are 'final', they are no longer revised. Affected data in this table are: 2006-2017 (final), 2018 (revised)  2019 (preliminary). For further information, see the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period (https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-release) and ABS Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period (https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/deaths-australia/latest-release).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Care needs to be taken in interpreting figures relating to intentional self-harm. For further information, see the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period (https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/causes-death-australia-methodology/2019).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.  Population estimates for non-Indigenous Australians were derived by subtracting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backcast population estimates and projections (series B) based on the 2016 Census from the total Australian Estimated Resident Population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. Data are reported for 5 jurisdictions combined—New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. These jurisdictions are considered to have adequate levels of Indigenous identification in mortality data. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. These data exclude 584 registered deaths where the Indigenous status was not stated over the period 2006–2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Deaths are counted according to year of registration, note that some deaths are not registered in the same year that it occurred. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9. Deaths for which the age at death was not recorded were excluded from the calculation of age-standardised rates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10. Coronial cases are more likely to be affected by a lag in registration time, especially those which are due to external causes (injury and poisoning), including intentional self-harm, homicide and drug-related deaths. Due to small numbers these lagged coroner-referred registrations can create large yearly variation in some causes of deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. Caution should be taken when making year to year analysis.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11. Data by causes of death have been adjusted for Victorian additional death registrations in 2019. A time series adjustment has been applied to causes of death to enable a more accurate comparison of mortality over time. When the time series adjustment is applied, deaths are presented in the year in which they were registered (i.e. removed from 2019 and added to 2017 or 2018). For further information see the methodology notes in ABS Causes of Deaths, Australia, 2019 reference period (https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/causes-death-australia-methodology/2019)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12. Deaths are counted according to year of registration of death, and state or territory of usual residence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
