"(a)  The following factors have not been taken into account in these statistics: students repeating a year of education, migration and other net changes to the school population, enrolment policies (including year starting high school which contributes to different age/grade structures between states and territories), inter-sector transfer and interstate movements of students. In some cases this has led to apparent retention rates exceeding 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(b) Average annual change in rates determined using linear regression analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c)The per cent change is based on the annual change over the period, using linear regression analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Retention rate = Year 10, 11 or 12 students as a proportion of the corresponding cohort from the first year of secondary schooling (Year 7/8).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(e) The category 'Other Australians' includes students whose Indigenous status was reported as 'not stated' or 'non-Indigenous'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(f) Retention rate = Year 12 students as a proportion of the corresponding cohort from Year 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(g) Retention rate = Year 12 students as a proportion of the corresponding cohort from Year 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Prior to 2015, all 7/8 cohorts are calculated using year 7 students from NSW, Vic, Tas, ACT, NT, and year 8 students from Qld, WA and SA. In 2015, the structure of schooling in Queensland and Western Australia changed, with Year 7 becoming the first year of secondary schooling. From 2015, all 7/8 cohorts are calculated using year 7 students from NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, Tas, ACT, NT, and year 8 students from SA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Since 2020 support students in NSW Government mainstream schools were recorded against their grade of enrolment. Care should be taken when comparing with previous years as enrolments will be higher due to the revised methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. In 2019, year 7 became the first year of secondary schooling in a number of non-government schools across SA. In 2020 year 7 became the first year of schooling in 3 Government schools across SA. In order to maintain cohort continuity in this table, year 8 is the commencement of secondary schooling for SA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
