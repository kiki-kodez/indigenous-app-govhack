"(a) 2021 IRSEO index was published by the Australian National University: https://caepr.cass.anu.edu.au/research/publications/area-level-socioeconomic-outcomes-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander. For this analysis, the AIHW divided Indigenous Areas (IAREs) into quintiles based on the IRSEO score, each including 80 or 81 IAREs. IAREs without an IRSEO score are shown in the 'not applicable' category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) Includes people in Other territories, those in migratory, offshore or shipping regions, and those with no usual address.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
