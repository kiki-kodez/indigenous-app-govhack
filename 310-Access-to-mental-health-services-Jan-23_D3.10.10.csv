(a) These figures differ from Australian hospital statistics 2017–18 due to differences in definitions and jurisdictional reporting.,,,,,,,,,
"(b) Caution should be used in interpreting Western Australia data for disaggregation by remoteness, as service location does not necessarily reflect the catchment area for that service.",,,,,,,,,
(c) Hospitals were allocated to a single remoteness category according to where the majority of their beds were reported. A different approach was taken to apportion beds (see Footnote d).,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Beds were allocated to remoteness by statistical area (SA2) of the hospital. Where SA2s included multiple remoteness areas, beds were apportioned according to the proportion of the SA2 population in each remoteness area.",,,,,,,,,
(e) Crude rates based on the preliminary Australian estimated resident population of the remoteness area as at 30 June 2017.,,,,,,,,,
