(a) The denominator is the total for the respective sex and grade for each state e.g year 7 males in NSW (i.e. the proportion of Indigenous or Other students to total students for the respective sex and grade for each state).,,,,,,,,,
(b) Includes full-time students only. Excludes years 1â€“6 and foundation year.,,,,,,,,,
"(c) Year 7 represents the first year of secondary school in all states except SA, in which most schools begin secondary school in year 8.",,,,,,,,,
(d) The category 'Other Australians' includes students whose Indigenous status was reported as 'not stated' or 'non-Indigenous'.,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,
1. Since 2020 support students in NSW Government mainstream schools were recorded against their grade of enrolment. Care should be taken when comparing with previous years as enrolments will be higher due to the revised methodology.,,,,,,,,,
"2. In 2019, year 7 became the first year of secondary schooling in a number of non-government schools across SA. In 2020 year 7 became the first year of schooling in 3 Government schools across SA. This table presents the sum of year 7 primary and year 7 secondary and therefore is not comparable to previous iterations.",,,,,,,,,
