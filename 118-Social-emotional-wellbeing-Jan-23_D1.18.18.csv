"(a) Age-standardised (age-std.) rates have been calculated using the direct method, with 2001 Australian population by 5-year age groups (up to 75+) as the standard population. ",,,,,,,,,
(b) Rate ratio is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians divided by the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,
(c) Rate difference is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians minus the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,
(d) Includes remote Victoria.,,,,,,,,,
(e) Excludes remote Victoria.,,,,,,,,,
(f) Total includes missing/unknown remoteness of usual residence.,,,,,,,,,
(g) Persons data includes sex not stated and indeterminate.,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,
1. Data are from public and private hospitals in all jurisdictions.,,,,,,,,,
2. Population denominators used to calculate rates were modelled by the AIHW using available ABS population estimates and projections (series B). ,,,,,,,,,
"3. Data are reported by remoteness of usual residence of the patient hospitalised, based on the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016. ",,,,,,,,,
"4. Categories are based on the ICD-10-AM 10th edition (Australian Consortium for Classification Development 2017): ICD-10-AM codes S00–T98 (principal diagnosis of Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes) and X60–X84 (external cause of intentional self-harm).",,,,,,,,,
"5. Data exclude hospitalisations for Newborns without qualified days, Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement.",,,,,,,,,
"6. Data exclude hospitalisations in WA with a contracted patient status of 'Inter-hospital contracted patient to private sector hospital', to adjust for hospitalisations recorded on both sides of contractual care arrangements.",,,,,,,,,
