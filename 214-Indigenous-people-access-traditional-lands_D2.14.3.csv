"(i) Self-reported data consisting of persons who reported having a disability or restrictive long-term health condition where a limitation, restriction, impairment, disease or disorder has lasted, or is expected to last for six months or more, and restricts everyday activities. Levels of activity limitation (profound, severe, moderate, mild and school/employment restriction only) are based on whether, and how often, a person needs help, has difficulty, or uses aids or equipment with any core activities (self-care, mobility or communication). A person's overall level of core activity limitation is determined by their highest level of limitation in any of these activities.",,,,,,,,
"(j) Includes those that are living with disability but reported no limitation or specific restriction with everyday activities of mobility, self-care and communication.",,,,,,,,
