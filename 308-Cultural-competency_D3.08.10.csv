† Proportion has a relative standard error between 25% and 50% and should be used with caution.,,,,,,,,,,,
(a) Self-reported data for people aged 15 and over in Non-remote areas who consulted a doctor or specialist in the last 12 months. Data excludes a small number of people who were not present at interview for whom responses were provided by a proxy. Categories have been updated in 2018–19 NATSIHS and are not time series comparable. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) Self-reported data consisting of persons who report having a disability or restrictive long-term health condition where a limitation, restriction, impairment, disease or disorder has lasted, or is expected to last for 6 months or more, and restricts everyday activities. Levels of activity limitation (profound, severe, moderate, mild and school/employment restriction only) are based on whether, and how often, a person needs help, has difficulty, or uses aids or equipment with any core activities (self-care, mobility or communication). A person's overall level of core activity limitation is determined by their highest level of limitation in any of these activities.",,,,,,,,,,,
(c) Only current difficulties with education and/or employment were collected. Respondents aged 65 and over were not asked about employment restrictions and so some may be categorised as not having a specific limitation or restriction that would otherwise have been assigned 'schooling/employment restriction only' had they been asked the question.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Includes those that are living with disability but reported no limitation or specific restriction with everyday activities of mobility, self-care and communication.",,,,,,,,,,,
(e) Based on the Kessler-5 (K5) measure of psychological distress. Overall levels of distress are based on how often respondents reported experiencing each feeling. Low/moderate is a score of 5–11. High/very high is a score of 12–25. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(f) Total population is 18 and over. Totals for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people exclude a small number of people who were not present at interview and for whom responses were provided by a proxy, and persons for whom level of psychological distress was unable to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(g)  Self-reported data consisting of persons reporting a current medical condition which has lasted, or is expected to last, for 6 months or more.",,,,,,,,,,,
Note: Percentages add within rows. Cells in this table have been randomly adjusted to avoid the release of confidential data. Discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals. ,,,,,,,,,,,
