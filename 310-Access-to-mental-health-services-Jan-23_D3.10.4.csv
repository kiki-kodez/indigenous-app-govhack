"(a) These data should be interpreted with caution due to likely under-identification of Indigenous Australians, see <https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/state-and-territory-community-mental-health-care-services/data-source>.",,,,,,,,,
(b) Data are reported by the jurisdiction that delivered the service and therefore include people receiving services in 1 jurisdiction who reside in another. Cross-border flows are particularly relevant when interpreting ACT data as the higher rates reported are likely to be due to residents from NSW receiving services in the ACT.,,,,,,,,,
(c) Rates have been directly age-standardised using the Australian 2001 standard population.,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Number per 1,000 population based on estimated resident population as at 30 June 2017.",,,,,,,,,
(e) Rate ratio is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians divided by the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,
(f) Rate difference is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians minus the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,
