† Estimate has a relative standard error between 25% and 50% and should be used with caution.,,,,,,,,,,,
(a) Self-reported data for people aged 15 and over in Non-remote areas who consulted a doctor or specialist in the last 12 months. Data excludes a small number of people who were not present at interview for whom responses were provided by a proxy. Categories have been updated in 2018–19 NATSIHS and are not time series comparable. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) Self-reported data consisting of persons who report having a disability or restrictive long-term health condition where a limitation, restriction, impairment, disease or disorder has lasted, or is expected to last for 6 months or more, and restricts everyday activities. Levels of activity limitation (profound, severe, moderate, mild and school/employment restriction only) are based on whether, and how often, a person needs help, has difficulty, or uses aids or equipment with any core activities (self-care, mobility or communication). A person's overall level of core activity limitation is determined by their highest level of limitation in any of these activities.",,,,,,,,,,,
(c) Only current difficulties with education and/or employment were collected. Respondents aged 65 and over were not asked about employment restrictions and so some may be categorised as not having a specific limitation or restriction that would otherwise have been assigned 'schooling/employment restriction only' had they been asked the question.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Includes those that are living with disability but reported no limitation or specific restriction with everyday activities of mobility, self-care and communication.",,,,,,,,,,,
(e) Based on the Kessler-5 (K5) measure of psychological distress. Overall levels of distress are based on how often respondents reported experiencing each feeling. Low/moderate is a score of 5–11. High/very high is a score of 12–25. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(f) Total population is 18 and over. Totals for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people exclude a small number of people who were not present at interview and for whom responses were provided by a proxy, and persons for whom level of psychological distress was unable to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(g)  Self-reported data consisting of persons reporting a current medical condition which has lasted, or is expected to last, for 6 months or more.",,,,,,,,,,,
Note: Cells in this table have been randomly adjusted to avoid the release of confidential data. Discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals. ,,,,,,,,,,,
