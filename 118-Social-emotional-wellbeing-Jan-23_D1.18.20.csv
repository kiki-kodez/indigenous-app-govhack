(c) Persons data includes sex not stated and indeterminate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Age-standardised rates have been calculated using the direct method, with 2001 Australian population by 5-year age groups (up to 75+) as the standard population. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(e Rate ratio is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians divided by the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(f) Rate difference is the age-standardised rate for Indigenous Australians minus the age-standardised rate for non-Indigenous Australians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Data reflect the state or territory of each patient’s usual residence, rather than the state or territory of the hospital they were admitted to, and exclude patients admitted to private hospitals in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Rates are calculated using ABS backcast population estimates and projections (series B) based on the 2016 Census.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. Categories are based on the ICD-10-AM 10th edition (Australian Consortium for Classification Development 2017) and previous editions: ICD-10-AM codes F00–F99, G30, R44, R48, G47.0, G47.1, G47.2, G47.8, G47.9, O99.3, R45.0, R45.1, R45.4, Z00.4, Z03.2, Z04.6, Z09.3, Z13.3, Z50.2, Z50.3, Z54.3, Z61.9, Z63.1, Z63.8, Z63.9, Z65.8, Z65.9, Z71.4, Z71.5, Z76.0. Information about the definition used can be found at https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/classifications-and-technical-notes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Data exclude hospitalisations for Newborns without qualified days, Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. Data exclude hospitalisations in WA with a contracted patient status of 'Inter-hospital contracted patient to private sector hospital', to adjust for hospitalisations recorded on both sides of contractual care arrangements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. From July 2015, a revision in the Australian Coding Standard ACS 2104 Rehabilitation was introduced to the ICD-10-AM. From July 2015, where patients were admitted to hospital specifically for rehabilitation, the principal diagnosis assigned is the condition which led to the need for rehabilitation, and Z50.9 was now assigned only as an additional diagnosis (prior to this, Z50.9 was assigned as the principal diagnosis with the reason for rehabilitation as the first additional diagnosis). This resulted in an increase in number of hospitalisations for disease principal diagnoses (for example, injury and poisoning).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: The care type Mental health was introduced from 1 July 2015. To change the care type of patients receiving mental health care, Queensland (in 2015–16) and New South Wales (in 2016–17) discharged and readmitted patients, causing the rise in hospitalisations and patient days counted in those years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
