"(a)  The following factors have not been taken into account in these statistics: students repeating a year of education, migration and other net changes to the school population, enrolment policies (including year starting high school which contributes to different age/grade structures between states and territories), inter-sector transfer and interstate movements of students. In some cases this has led to apparent retention rates exceeding 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b)  In small jurisdictions, relatively small changes in student numbers can create apparently large movements in retention rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(c) Only full time students included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(d) The category 'Other Australians' includes students whose Indigenous status was reported as 'not stated' or 'non-Indigenous'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(e) Retention rate = Year 10, 11 or 12 students in 2021 as a proportion of the Year 7/8 students in 2018/2019, 2017/2018 and 2016/2017, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(f)Â  Retention rate = Year 12 students in 2021 as a proportion of the Year 10 students in 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(g) Retention rate = Year 12 students in 2021 as a proportion of the Year 11 students in 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Year 7/8 cohorts are calculated using year 7 students from NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, Tas, ACT, NT, and year 8 students from SA. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Since 2020 support students in NSW Government mainstream schools were recorded against their grade of enrolment. Care should be taken when comparing with previous years as enrolments will be higher due to the revised methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
